### 14.	INDEMNIFICATION

#### 14.1	By You

You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Gecko and our Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, liabilities, losses, reasonable expenses or costs (collectively, “Losses”) incurred as a result of any third party claim arising from (i) You and/or any of your Authorized Users’, violation of these TOS or applicable law; and/or (ii) Bundled Products, Customer Data and/or Customer Content, including the use of Bundled Products, Customer Data and/or Customer Content by Gecko and/or any of our subcontractors, which infringes or violates, any third party’s rights, including, without limitation, Intellectual Property Rights.

#### 14.2	By Gecko

(a)	Gecko hereby agrees to defend You, your Affiliates, officers, directors, and employees, in and against any third party claim or demand against You, alleging that your authorized use of the Software Offerings infringes or constitutes misappropriation of any third party’s copyright, trademark or registered Malaysian patent (the “IP Claim”), and we will indemnify You and hold You harmless against any damages and costs finally awarded on such IP Claim by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to via settlement we agreed upon, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.

(b)	Gecko’s indemnity obligations under Section 14.2(a) shall not apply if: (i) the Software Offerings (or any portion thereof) were modified by You or any of your Authorized Users or any third party, but solely to the extent the IP Claim would have been avoided by not doing such modification; (ii) if the Software Offerings are used in combination with any other service, device, software or products, including, without limitation, Third-Party Content or Third-Party Services, but solely to the extent that such IP Claim would have been avoided without such combination; and/or (iii) any IP Claim arising or related to, Third Party Content, Third Party Services, Customer Data, Customer Content, or to any events giving rise to your indemnity obligations under Section 14.1 above. Without derogating from the foregoing defense and indemnification obligation, if Gecko believes that the Software Offerings, or any part thereof, may so infringe, then Gecko may in our sole discretion: (a) obtain (at no additional cost to You) the right to continue to use the Software Offerings; (b) replace or modify the allegedly infringing part of the Software Offerings so that it becomes non-infringing while giving substantially equivalent performance; or (c) if Gecko determines that the foregoing remedies are not reasonably available, then Gecko may require that use of the (allegedly) infringing Software Offerings (or part thereof) shall cease and in such an event, You shall receive a prorated refund of any Fees paid for the unused portion of the Subscription Term. THIS SECTION 14.2 STATES GECKO’S SOLE AND ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, FOR ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION BY GECKO AND/OR OUR SOFTWARE OFFERINGS, AND UNDERLYING GECKO MATERIALS.


#### 14.3	Indemnity Conditions
The defense and indemnification obligations of the indemnifying Party (the “Indemnitor”) under this Section 14 are subject to: (i) the indemnified Party (the “Indemnitee”) promptly providing a written notice of the claim for which an indemnification is being sought, provided that such Indemnitee’s failure to do so will not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations under this Section 14.3, except to the extent the Indemnitor’s defense is materially prejudiced thereby; (ii) the Indemnitor being given immediate and exclusive control over the defense and/or settlement of the claim, provided, however that the Indemnitor shall not enter into any compromise or settlement of any such claim that that requires any monetary obligation or admission of liability or any unreasonable responsibility or liability by an Indemnitee without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (iii) the Indemnitee providing reasonable cooperation and assistance, at the Indemnitor’s expense, in the defense and/or settlement of such claim and not taking any action that prejudices the Indemnitor’s defense of, or response to, such claim.
